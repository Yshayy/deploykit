# Deploykit
A Deno based toolkit for generating deployment configuration files using typescript with focus on k8s resources.
Inspired by Pulumi, JKCfg, CDK, Helm and others...

# Examples


# Why Deno
The aim of this project, is to simplify typescript-configuration based deployment. 
Deno provide some capabilites in the area:

* No need for typescript toolchain (tsc, prettier, etc...)
* No need to manage dependencies or package.json or deployment project folder
* Sandboxed security - scripts can generate configuration files and nothing more

This capabilies allow us to easy create a single deploy.ts that use imports that are easy to manage, execute or integrated in CI/CD
